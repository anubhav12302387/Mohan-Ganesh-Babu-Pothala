      `I'm on a mission to create captivating and inspiring online experiences that leave a lasting impact. With each line of code I write, I'm excited to learn, grow, and push the boundaries of what's possible in this ever-evolving field.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
      `But now, I'm a Pro. I've been coding in React, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind, C, C++,PHP,Logo and YouDontKnowShit programming language etc to name a few. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer I'm laughing right now.`,
